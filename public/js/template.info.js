Revaluta Banking enables the owner to have alternative types of value exchanges in transactions with others, beyond the realm of the gold-backed currency types.</p></div>\n								</li>\n							  <li>\n									<div class="collapsible-header">Why is there a number on the Revaluta Notes?</div>\n									<div class="collapsible-body"><p>Revaluta Notes are physical valuenotes, coupled with a unique number and coupled online individual note account. It enables users to read or "bank" stories generated by users on this note. The Revaluta currencies are designed to be pro-social, non-financial currency aimed at generating added value for all parties involved, by introducing new types of preferred transactional interactions between individuals. These transactions are in reality social experiments resulting from an era where financial currencies and the possibilities it gives the owners are distributed unequally. Because these Revaluta Notes, and the concepts they stem from, are new to the world, we gather the stories created by them as examples, coupling these inspirational stories in a string assigned to the unique notes number. When the notenumber is added on the <a href="http://bank.complementarycurrency.info/">Revaluta site</a>, the story can be shared online.</p></div>\n								</li>\n							  <li>\n									<div class="collapsible-header">How do these notes work?</div>\n									<div class="collapsible-body">\n										<p>The first set of Revaluta Notes is an edition of 5 notes:</p> \n										<p><u>One Man Army</u>: Here you can enlist the name of the hero, the challenge at hand, and the company he or she will make better. It is a type of currency where as one individual to another, you invest your trust in their ability to make a positive change in his or her corporation, a challenge the receiver can accept or reject.</p>\n										<p><u>One Percent</u>:Here you can enlist the name &amp; donationlinks of the project the valuenote is generating funding for, and pass it on. It is a type of currency to crowdfund your dreamproject by demonstrating and communicate it clearly, leading your supporters to chipping in 1%.</p>\n										<p><u>Zero Trillion Euro</u>: Here you can receive vip access to the zero trillionaires club. A type of currency that would counter the feeling of poverty, instead of one that stimulates greed.</p>\n										<p><u>Nulro</u>: Here you can describe the offer you’d like to make, and the possible non-monetary exchanges for it. It is a type of currency that would end the need for euros, by exchanging with closed wallets in a wish-list matching a offer-list..</p>\n										<p><u>Worthalot</u>: Here you can enlist the name &amp; compliments for the special person who is honored by receiving the note. It is a type of currency that could truly validate and honor a person for his or her worth, and have it registered, forever.</p>\n									</div>\n								</li>\n							  <li>\n									<div class="collapsible-header">Why was the Revaluta Bank created?</div>\n									<div class="collapsible-body">\n									  <p>In a past era, people in society invented the use of money, paper stating worth backed by promises of gold or value. It was a wonderful tool to help us doing more together and smoothen transactions and trades amongst each other. The influence of this system of using money has been growing, commoditizing goods and services wherever it can. And although money has been a brilliant and useful invention, it’s not perfect.</p>\n										<p>Some obvious cracks and faults in the system are starting to appear which have to be dealt with. There is spectacular economic inequality, and a growing group of people are limited in what they want to do by their lack of money to pay for it in the regular currency. The bias for skewed allocation of portions of wealth is inherent to the system, which is an obstacle for progress towards a fairer future for all. Money was created as a tool for exchanging more easily amongst each other, the financial banking institutions should not allow this human invention to become the main cause separating people into socio-economic strata, into groups of ‘have-lots’ or ‘have-nots’: The childish grapple on illogical entitlements of materials and perceived ownership has to go, for the human race to thrive as a humane collective and provide the option of comfortable survival for all.</p>\n										<p>Willing to support the downfall of the separation of individuals sparked by scarcity-economics, powered by greed and irresponsible ownership entitlements, the Revaluta Alliance, spearheaded by the Terra Futura Foundation and their teams, came together in 2013. To act. Its members create new types of money-systems to add alternate cashflows that enhances cooperation, caring &amp; sharing amongst each other. Money available for all to blend with the current money supply dominated by temporary surplus generating schemes without the respect for sustaining future generations. Schemes that are not in tune or in balance with the concrete physical capacity of the planet, or the psychological default to ideals of cooperation, sharing &amp; caring, that the majority of humans, but not all, seem to share.</p>\n										<p>We are not alone in our wish create better societal system, and there are other solutions and pilots. Already some 200 complementary currencies have appeared worldwide. It fills an economic gap, creates community and facilitates topical awareness by adding an additional currency system, next to, or in partial replacement of the regular currency. Some are based on intra-community transaction, or currency usable in a specific geographical region, others on time-banking, and so on. These initiatives like ‘Brixton Pound’, ‘Noppes’, ‘Makkie’ help people get together and do transactions not possible in the realm of the Euro. However, the gap is large and growing. On the long term a transition towards a new economic model seems inevitable, whether it will be jumpstarted by the emergence of immediate necessity or by complementary currencies gradually replacing the regular currency, and thereby the economic model it supports.</p>\n										<p>If we would choose not to wait, we would have to starting creating new currencies that would support new economic principles. And as it seems, we have chosen not to wait, moving the concept forward, and setting our ambitious as high as we do.</p>\n									</div>\n								</li>\n							  <li>\n									<div class="collapsible-header">What is a Gift Economy?</div>\n									<div class="collapsible-body">\n									  <p>The Revaluta Bank is the first step to create currency, inspired by the alternate economic model of the “gift-economy”. A gift-economy is a very old human type of economy, predating valuta as a solution,  where your worth and social standing are based on how much you can share, produce and give in useful items and services onto others, rather than having status based on your purchasing power without regards for your personal contribution in it.</p>\n										<p>In this perspective on economy its not about what you have, but about what you can create and thereby ‘gift’ to another (without monetary reciprocation as a limiting condition) as a proof of your worth. In recent times, the concept and societal model of the ‘gift-economy’ has attracted very large attention and interest, but these are high-minded ideals and localized projects. No serious attempt was made to actually smoothen this economy by creating useful complementary currency to ‘oil the economic cogwheels’ by creating physical currency notes, the Revaluta Bank decided in 2015 to start making this happen, and bankroll the early adopters of these principles with the Revaluta Notes.</p>\n									</div>\n								</li>\n							  <li>\n									<div class="collapsible-header">Why the name Revaluta?</div>\n									<div class="collapsible-body">\n									  <p>The notes are called “Revaluta”, for it’s a response, a reaction to the current valuta, and a revolutionairy one, because it aims to change outdated systems, and have it replaced by something better. If you have Revaluta, you are enabled, allowed and invited to use them in your dealings with yourself and others around.</p>\n									</div>\n								</li>\n							  <li>\n									<div class="collapsible-header">Who is the Revaluta Alliance?</div>\n									<div class="collapsible-body">\n									  <p>The Revaluta Alliance is coordinated by the Terra Futura Foundation of Holland. The process is made possible by the support of teammembers Coder Joost van der Schee, Coder Charif Mews, Coder Tom Blauwendraat, Bankmanager Tjerk Feitsma, the PR team, Designer Myra Beckers, Desinger Sjoerd Olislagers en Illustrator Mashab. The bank supports the mission of partner OnsGeld.nu to forge a referendum about money creation. The bank itself was supported by the Alert Fund for Youth to cover 24% of total costs, and by Drukkerij Hazenberg in 64% of printingcosts.</p>\n									</div>\n								</li>\n              </ul>\n							<h5 class="center">Noteworthy links</h5>\n							<div class="collection">\n								<a href="https://www.facebook.com/1575771849363463/photos/a.1575774922696489.1073741828.1575771849363463/1575777709362877/?type=1&amp;__mref=message_bubble" class="collection-item">Search new Vault for Revaluta Notes</a>\n								<a href="https://www.facebook.com/1575771849363463/photos/a.1575774922696489.1073741828.1575771849363463/1575775186029796/?type=1&amp;__mref=message_bubble" class="collection-item">First sets of Revaluta Complementary Currency distributed.</a>\n								<a href="https://www.facebook.com/1575771849363463/photos/a.1575774922696489.1073741828.1575771849363463/1575780419362606/?type=1&amp;__mref=message_bubble" class="collection-item">Inspirators of the Worthalot Currency</a>\n								<a href="https://www.facebook.com/1575771849363463/photos/a.1575774922696489.1073741828.1575771849363463/1575779326029382/?type=1&amp;theater&amp;__mref=message_bubble" class="collection-item">The prime example of the One Man Army</a>\n							</div>\n						</div>\n					</div>\n					<!--<div class="col s12 m6">-->\n						<!--<div class="icon-block card">-->\n							<!--<h5 class="center">Revaluta Bank explained</h5>-->\n							<!--<p class="light">One Worthalot can be handed out to a person who is, or who has done something amazing.
